## Technical Design

Always design code to be modular with components where possible, so that individual files do not get too large.

## Expansion Guidelines

When adding new features:
1. Follow the existing component architecture
2. Create new files for major new systems
3. Extend existing classes rather than modifying them
4. Add appropriate event emissions for cross-component communication
5. Document new systems with clear comments
6. Maintain consistent naming conventions
7. Consider performance implications, especially for visual effects
8. For multiplayer features, always consider:
   - Server authority and validation
   - Network bandwidth optimization
   - State synchronization requirements
   - Anti-cheat implications
